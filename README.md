This repository contains the complete versions of the Smart Coach program

## Smart Coach
Smart coach is a program designed to gamify and improve the workout-from-home experience for people with no to intermediate experience with physical training. Its main functions include analyzing the forms of certain exercises performed and providing customized feedbacks. As a prototype, the program currently (31 Oct, 2021) supports only bodyweight squats. More excersizes maybe included in the future.

The program follows the guidelines by “The Bodyweight Squat: A Movement Screen for the Squat Pattern.” (Kritz, Matthew, et al. ,2009), added with some tolerance trained with real human samples to compensate for the variation in camera settings.
