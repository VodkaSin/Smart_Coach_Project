## Smart Coach
Smart coach is a program designed to gamify and improve the workout-from-home experience for people with no to intermediate experience with physical training. Its main functions include analyzing the forms of certain exercises performed and providing customized feedbacks. As a prototype, the program currently (31 Oct, 2021) supports only bodyweight squats. More excersizes maybe included in the future.

The squat algorithm follows the guidelines by “The Bodyweight Squat: A Movement Screen for the Squat Pattern.” (Kritz, Matthew, et al. ,2009), added with some tolerance trained with real human samples to compensate for the variation in camera settings.

In the data analysis portion, we show three difference charts: heart rate and blood oxygen evolution with time during the workout, time in each heart rate zone, and calories burned. The main references for this section are 'Exercise intensity: How to measure it.' (Mayo Clinic, 2018) and 'Prediction of Energy Expenditure from Heart Rate Monitoring During Submaximal Exercise' (Keytel et al., 2005). Note that for the calories estimation, heart rates exceeding 150bpm may lead to inaccuracies. The user should take the results at his/her/their own discretion.
